# Introduction
The Republic of Mauritius recognizes health as a basic human right, and sees health as an enabler for human development and inclusive growth. In the Health Sector Strategic Plan 2020-2024, the Ministry of Health & Wellness (MOHW) provides the following vision[^1]:

!!!
A healthy nation with a constantly improving quality of life and well-being
!!!

To achieve this vision, the MOHW has laid out the following **mission**:

1. Reinforce our health services into a modern, high-performing, quality health system that is patient-centered, accessible, equitable, efficient and innovative.  
2. Improve quality of life and well-being of the population through the prevention of communicable and non-communicable diseases, promote healthy lifestyles and an environment conducive to health.  
3. Harness the full potential of information and communication technology to empower people to live healthy lives.  
4. Ensure that the available human, financial and physical resources lead to the achievement of better health outcomes.  
5. Facilitate the development of the Republic of Mauritius into a medical and knowledge hub and support the advancement of health tourism.

## Digital health objectives
As evidenced by its mission, the MOHW recognizes the value of information and communication technology (ICT) in improving health outcomes. It envisions a national digital system that enables continuity of care through affordable, high-quality, user-centric services to all healthcare stakeholders in Mauritius — by achieving the following eHealth objectives[^2]:

1. A single integrated source of information (National Patient Database – **One Patient One Record**) and a focal point of reference on all matters related to health;

2. **Improving clinical outcomes** through better client-centric service delivery & high levels of internal efficiency and effectiveness;

3. **Guiding resource planning**, allocation, monitoring and evaluation;

4. **Improving health awareness** levels in citizens and residents of key issues in personal/ public health & use of technology;

5. **Enhancing competency** levels of healthcare staff at all levels and across organization types **towards ICT** to deliver better healthcare;

6. **Improving collaboration** between the sector stakeholders using interoperability, standardization, and cooperative knowledge exchange; and

7. **Ensuring health data privacy** by protecting  personal, health and other confidential information and disclosure to authorized stakeholders only on a need-to-know basis. 

These objectives provide a basis on which a nationwide digital health system can be conceptualized, and given form through this **Digital Health Architecture and Blueprint (DHAB)**.
